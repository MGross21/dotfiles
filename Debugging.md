# Debugging

A collection of strange gotchas and debug moments

## Login to Twitch

When logging in, I received an `"Incompatible Browser"` error, even though Firefox is supported.

**Fix:** The issue was with the [system clock](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=289645).

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone <time-zone>   # e.g., America/Phoenix
sudo timedatectl enable systemd-timesyncd --now
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

# Verify status
timedatectl status
```

You should see output similar to:

```md
Time zone: <time-zone>
System clock synchronized: yes
NTP service: active
```

## System Dark Mode

Some websites use your system's dark mode setting.  
To control this on Linux:

1. Install a GTK settings manager
2. Use the GUI to set your preferred theme.

## Using OAuth to Login to GitHub via VSCode

If you encounter a `"Missing OS Keyring"` error:

1. Install the necessary keyring packages (e.g., `gnome-keyring`, `libsecret`).
2. Set the keyring password to match your user password.
3. Restart your system or re-source your shell profile.

To configure VSCode:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments**.
2. Add `"password-store": "gnome-libsecret"` to your `argv.json` file.
3. Restart VSCode (`"Developer: Reload Window"` menu option will not work)

## Returning the Charge Light Functionality to MSI Laptops

If the charge LED stopped working after switching to Linux, try resetting the embedded controller (EC):

### EC Reset Steps

1. Power off the laptop completely.
2. Unplug the AC adapter.
3. Hold the power button for 30â€“60 seconds.
4. Plug the AC adapter back in.
5. Power on the laptop.

This often restores the charge LED functionality on MSI laptops.
